# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub. Don't know what I'm going to do with this.
In fact, I must have hit a button inadvertently and one more click (on readme) I'm here.
I feel like a total noob. Actually, I AM a total noob here! Just following the GitHub guide.
Is this the "commit message" or...(down below?)
